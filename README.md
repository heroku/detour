## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'detour'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

In your rails app:

    $ bundle exec rails generate detour

Run the Detour migrations:

    $ bundle exec rake db:migrate

## Usage

`Detour` works by determining whether or not a specific record
should have features accessible to it based on individual flags, flags for a
percentage of records, or flags for a programmable group of records.

### Configuration

Edit `config/initializers/detour.rb`:

```ruby
Detour.configure do |config|
  # Detour needs to know at boot which models will
  # have flags defined for them:
  config.flaggable_types = %w[User Widget]

  # Detour needs to know what directories to search
  # through in order to find places where you're
  # checking for flags in your code. Provide it an
  # array of glob strings:
  config.feature_search_dirs = %w[app/**/*.{rb,erb}]

  # Provide a default class to manage rollouts for, if
  # desired. This means you can omit the class name from
  # rake tasks:
  config.default_flaggable_class_name = "User"
end
```

Mount the app in `config/routes.rb`:

```ruby
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  mount Detour::Engine => "/detour"
end
```

### Marking a model as flaggable

In addition to listing classes that are flaggable in your initializer, add
`acts_as_flaggable` to the class definitions themselves:

```ruby
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  acts_as_flaggable
end
```

Or, in order to user emails rather than IDs to identify records in rake tasks:

```ruby
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  acts_as_flaggable find_by: :email
end
```

This module adds `has_many` associations to `User` for `flaggable_flags` (where
the user has been individually flagged into a feature), `opt_out_flags` (where
the user has been opted out of a feature), and `features` (the features that
the user has been individually flagged into, regardless of opt outs).

However, these methods aren't enough to determine whether or not the user is
flagged into a specific feature. The `#has_feature?` method provided by
`Detour::Flaggable` should be used for this.

### Determining if a record is flagged into a feature

Call the `#has_feature?` method on an instance of your class that implements
`acts_as_flaggable`.

```ruby
if current_user.has_feature? :new_user_interface
  render_new_user_interface
end
```

### Defining programmatic groups

A specific group of records matching a given block can be flagged into a
feature. In order to define these groups, use
`Detour.configure`:

```ruby
Detour.configure do |config|
  # Any User that returns truthy for `user.admin?` will be included in this
  # group: `admins`.
  config.define_user_group :admins do |user|
    user.admin?
  end

  # Any FizzBuzz that returns truthy for `fizz_buzz.bar?` will be included in
  # this group: `is_bar`.
  config.define_fizz_buzz_group :is_bar do |fizz_buzz|
    fizz_buzz.bar?
  end
end
```
